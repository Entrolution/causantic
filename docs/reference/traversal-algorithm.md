# Chain Walking Algorithm Reference

Causantic uses a chain-walking algorithm to reconstruct episodic narratives from the causal memory graph.

## Overview

The causal graph is a **sequential linked list** with branch points at sub-agent forks, team edges, and cross-session links. The chain walker uses **multi-path DFS with backtracking** to explore all reachable paths from seed chunks, emitting each as a candidate chain. `selectBestChain()` picks the winner by highest median per-node cosine similarity.

| Direction    | Edge following                            | Use case                            |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Backward** | Follow edges where target = current chunk | `recall` — "how did we solve this?" |
| **Forward**  | Follow edges where source = current chunk | `predict` — "what comes next?"      |

## Core Algorithm

```typescript
function walkChains(seedIds: string[], options: ChainWalkerOptions): Chain[];
```

### Pseudocode

```
function walkChains(seedIds, options):
    allCandidates = []

    for each seed in seedIds:                   // Per-seed independence
        candidates = walkAllPaths(seed, options)
        allCandidates.append(...candidates)

    return allCandidates

function walkAllPaths(seedId, options):
    candidates = []
    scoreCache = Map()
    expansions = 0
    pathVisited = Set()                         // Per-path, not global
    pathState = { chunkIds: [], scores: [], tokens: 0 }

    // Initialize with seed (oversized seeds traversed but excluded from path)
    pathVisited.add(seedId)
    if seedChunk.tokens <= tokenBudget:
        pushToPath(seedId)

    dfs(seedId, depth=1, consecutiveSkips=0)
    return candidates

function dfs(currentId, depth, consecutiveSkips):
    if ++expansions > maxExpansions: return
    if candidates.length >= maxCandidates: return

    edges = getEdges(currentId, direction)
    unvisited = edges.filter(e => !pathVisited.has(e.nextId))

    // Terminal: dead end or depth limit — emit candidate
    if unvisited is empty OR depth >= maxDepth:
        emit(currentPath)
        return

    for each edge in unvisited:
        chunk = getChunk(edge.nextId)
        pathVisited.add(edge.nextId)

        // Agent filter: skip but traverse
        if agentFilter and chunk.agentId != agentFilter:
            if consecutiveSkips + 1 <= maxSkippedConsecutive:
                dfs(edge.nextId, depth + 1, consecutiveSkips + 1)
            pathVisited.delete(edge.nextId)
            continue

        // Oversized chunk: pass through without adding to path
        if chunk.tokens > tokenBudget:
            dfs(edge.nextId, depth + 1, 0)      // Continue traversal
            pathVisited.delete(edge.nextId)
            continue

        score = scoreNode(edge.nextId)          // Memoized
        if tokens + chunk.tokens > tokenBudget:
            emit(currentPath)                   // Budget hit — emit, don't extend
            pathVisited.delete(edge.nextId)
            continue

        push(edge.nextId, score, chunk.tokens)  // Extend path
        dfs(edge.nextId, depth + 1, 0)          // Reset skip counter
        pop()                                   // Backtrack
        pathVisited.delete(edge.nextId)
```

### Chain Selection

```
function selectBestChain(chains):
    qualifying = chains.filter(c => c.length >= 2)
    if qualifying is empty: return null

    // Median per-node similarity — robust to outliers on short chains
    return qualifying.maxBy(c => c.medianScore)
```

## Key Design Decisions

### Multi-path DFS vs greedy single-path

Prior to v0.8.0, the walker used greedy single-path traversal: `pickBestEdge()` selected ONE edge per node (highest `initialWeight`), discarding all alternatives. This worked for linear chains (out-degree 1) but missed alternative paths at branching points (agent transitions, team edges, cross-session links).

Multi-path DFS explores all branches and emits each terminal path as a candidate. `selectBestChain()` gets a proper candidate set. For linear chains, behavior is identical — exactly 1 candidate per seed.

### Per-seed independence

Each seed explores independently with its own per-path visited set. No global visited set across seeds. This allows different seeds on the same chain to both produce candidates through shared nodes. `selectBestChain()` picks the single best chain regardless of which seed produced it.

### Mutable backtracking state

Path state (`chunkIds`, `chunks`, `nodeScores`, token count) uses push/pop with backtracking rather than array spread. This avoids O(depth) allocation per step. `pathVisited` uses `.add()` on entry and `.delete()` on backtracking return.

### Agent filter scoping

When `agentFilter` is set and a non-matching chunk is encountered, the chunk is skipped (not added to output) but its edges are explored. `consecutiveSkips` is passed as a parameter to recursion — each recursive frame gets its own count, reset to 0 when a matching chunk is found. This prevents cross-frame interference during backtracking.

### Oversized chunk passthrough

Chunks individually larger than the token budget are treated as transparent nodes: traversed for graph connectivity but excluded from the path output, token count, and median score. This prevents a single large chunk from breaking an otherwise viable chain. The same applies to oversized seeds — they serve as DFS starting points but don't appear in the output.

### Budget-aware chain formatting

After chain selection, the output assembly iterates through chunks in order and only includes those that fit within the remaining token budget. Chunks that would exceed the budget are dropped entirely — no partial chunks are returned. Step numbering (`[1/N]`) reflects included chunks only.

## Pipeline Integration

The chain walker is part of the episodic retrieval pipeline:

```
Query
  │
  ├─ 1. Embed query
  ├─ 2. Vector search + keyword search (parallel)
  ├─ 3. RRF fusion + cluster expansion → top-5 seeds
  │
  ├─ 4. walkChains(seedIds, { direction, tokenBudget, queryEmbedding })
  │     ├─ For each seed, DFS with backtracking explores all paths
  │     ├─ Oversized chunks (> tokenBudget) passed through, not added to path
  │     ├─ Emit candidate at: dead end, depth limit, or token budget
  │     └─ Per-path visited set prevents cycles within a path
  │
  ├─ 5. selectBestChain(candidates) → highest median per-node similarity with ≥ 2 chunks
  │
  ├─ 6. If chain found → budget-aware formatting (drop chunks exceeding remaining budget)
  │     └─ Reverse for chronological output (recall only)
  └─ 7. Else → fall back to search-style ranked results
```

## Edge Structure

Edges are stored as single `forward` rows:

| Field             | Value                                                                                                     |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `edge_type`       | Always `'forward'`                                                                                        |
| `reference_type`  | `'within-chain'`, `'cross-session'`, `'brief'`, `'debrief'`, `'team-spawn'`, `'team-report'`, `'peer-message'` |
| `source_chunk_id` | Earlier chunk                                                                                             |
| `target_chunk_id` | Later chunk                                                                                               |
| `initial_weight`  | Varies by type: 1.0 (`within-chain`), 0.9 (`brief`/`debrief`/`team-spawn`/`team-report`), 0.85 (`peer-message`), 0.7 (`cross-session`) |

Direction is inferred at query time:

- **Forward edges**: `source_chunk_id = chunkId AND edge_type = 'forward'`
- **Backward edges**: `target_chunk_id = chunkId AND edge_type = 'forward'`

## Chain Scoring

Each node in a chain is scored by cosine similarity to the query:

```
nodeScore = 1 - angularDistance(queryEmbedding, chunkEmbedding)
```

Chain selection uses the **median** per-node score:

```
chain.nodeScores = [nodeScore for each node]
chain.medianScore = median(chain.nodeScores)
```

Median is robust to bridge nodes (semantic novelty) in short chains. A 3-node chain with scores `[0.85, 0.30, 0.82]` gets median `0.82` instead of mean `0.66`, correctly recognizing that most of the chain is highly relevant despite one bridge node.

## Configuration

### ChainWalkerOptions

```typescript
interface ChainWalkerOptions {
  direction: 'forward' | 'backward';
  tokenBudget: number;          // Max tokens per path
  queryEmbedding: number[];     // For per-node scoring
  maxDepth?: number;            // Safety cap (default: 50)
  agentFilter?: string;         // Skip non-matching chunks
  maxSkippedConsecutive?: number; // Abandon branch after N skips (default: 5)
  maxCandidatesPerSeed?: number; // Cap on emitted chains per seed (default: 10)
  maxExpansionsPerSeed?: number; // Cap on DFS recursive calls per seed (default: 200)
}
```

### Memory Config

```json
{
  "traversal": {
    "maxDepth": 50
  }
}
```

`maxDepth` limits the maximum chain depth. For most collections, the token budget is the effective limit. `maxExpansionsPerSeed` bounds DFS cost on rare dense subgraphs.

## Performance Characteristics

| Aspect           | Behavior                                                                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Time complexity  | O(S × E) where S = seeds (5), E = expansions per seed (≤200)                  |
| Space complexity | O(D) where D = max path depth (mutable backtracking state)                     |
| Edge lookups     | O(1) per hop via indexed queries                                               |
| Scoring          | O(1) per unique node (memoized — in-memory vector Map lookup + dot product)    |

### Bounding DFS Cost

Two independent limits prevent runaway exploration:

1. **`maxExpansionsPerSeed = 200`** — pre-order counter incremented at each DFS recursive call. Aborts entire seed's DFS when reached.
2. **`maxCandidatesPerSeed = 10`** — cap on emitted chains per seed. Early-exit once enough candidates are collected.

With typical out-degree 1 (linear chains), a seed's DFS visits ~50 nodes (1 path). At branching points (out-degree 2-3), total expansions are ~60-100. The 200-expansion budget is generous for typical graphs and protective against rare dense subgraphs.

### Score Memoization

`Map<string, number>` cache for `scoreNode()` results per seed walk. A node at depth 1 that branches to 3 paths would otherwise be scored 3 times. Each node is scored at most once per seed.

## Comparison to Previous Algorithms

### v0.2: Sum-Product Traversal

- Explored **all paths** from seeds, accumulating weights multiplicatively
- Handled cycles via geometric attenuation (weight-based pruning)
- Required hop-based decay curves and `minWeight` threshold
- O(E × D) complexity where E = edges explored

### v0.3–v0.7: Greedy Single-Path

- Followed **one edge per node** (highest `initialWeight`), building a single chain per seed
- Handled cycles via global visited set (O(1) lookup)
- No decay curves needed — scoring uses direct cosine similarity to query
- O(S × L) complexity — fast but missed alternative paths at branching points

### v0.8: Multi-Path DFS

- Explores **all paths** from each seed via DFS with backtracking
- Handles cycles via per-path visited set (add on entry, delete on backtrack)
- Emits candidate at every terminal condition (dead end, depth limit, token budget)
- Bounded by `maxExpansionsPerSeed` (200) and `maxCandidatesPerSeed` (10)
- For linear chains (out-degree 1), behavior identical to v0.3–v0.7
